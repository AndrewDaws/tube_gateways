# Getting Started with Zigbee Routers

This guide covers the initial setup and pairing for all TubesZB Zigbee Routers.

## Pairing Your Router

The process is designed to be as simple as possible. Your router will automatically try to join a Zigbee network when it's first powered on.

1.  **Enable Pairing:** In your Zigbee platform (like ZHA or Zigbee2MQTT), enable "permit join" mode to allow new devices to connect.

2.  **Power On the Router:** Plug the router into a suitable USB power source.
    * **Current Models:** Use a 5V 1-2A power supply with a **USB-C** cable.
    * **Older Models:** Use a 5V 1-2A power supply with a **Micro-USB** cable.

3.  **Wait for Pairing:** The router should now be discovered and join your Zigbee network automatically. You will see it appear in your Zigbee integration's device list.

If the router does not pair, try power cycling it once while your network is still in pairing mode. For more advanced operations, please see the specific documentation for your router model.
